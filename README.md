# ParchEZ

This project was built as part of the Prime Digital Academy Full Stack Engineering program. It is meant to play the board game parcheesi online with friends. You must simply log in or create an account, and then click create game. Once you have created a game you will be given a code that you can send to your friends. All they need to do is paste it into the join game area and join the lobby. After that you can play. After the game if you go to the stats area you can see how many games you have won and lost plus your winrate. There you can also delete your account.
